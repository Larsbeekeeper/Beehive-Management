RP as an webserver and communication unit between local Arduino units and a sentral DB

I'm not an experienced developer in the area I move into here and I guess there is a lot of solutions to built this solution on and is very happy for guiding to good solution.  I will come back to the functionality I need in the solution.

The mail goal is to create an cheep solution to communicate to and from behives.  Help me get beekeeping simple so we can do a job in polination of flowers.  This begin to be critical and we need simple beekeeping methods.
