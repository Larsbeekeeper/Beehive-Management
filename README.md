# Beehive Management-

There will be some branches of this prosject.
1: Physical equipment to use in the beehive based on the Langstroth standard
2: "Robot"-functionality inside the beehive, based on Arduino processors
3: Local communication in the apiary (beeyard) and storing of data using Rasberry Pi with Raspbian
4: communicate data between the local storage (also with using Rasberry Pi) and central warehouses for analysing data
5: Storing manual observations thru mobile phone equipment - initially only for Android phones
6: Using XXXX-system for central warehousing


RP as an webserver and communication unit between local Arduino units and a sentral DB

I'm not an experienced developer in the area I move into here and I guess there is a lot of solutions to built this solution on and is very happy for guiding to good solution.  I will come back to the functionality I need in the solution.

The mail goal is to create an cheep solution to communicate to and from behives.  Help me get beekeeping simple so we can do a job in polination of flowers.  This begin to be critical and we need simple beekeeping methods.
